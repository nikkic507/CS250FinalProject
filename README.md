# CS250FinalProject
I started by asking questions about how to improve the end user's experience and what they would like to see in the future from SNHU Travel. I created user stories for these needs and also decided what the testing criteria would be for acceptance testing. These user stories helped keep the idea focused on the end users and their needs. It also helped communicate those needs across the team so that the deliverables met those needs efficiently. My approach in developing programs is to ask relevant questions to my client, stakeholders, and end users so I can have a basis to start with. The agile processes I hope to incorporate is the organization, communication, and independence. I hope to use some of the tools I learned about such as the Azure Boards when planning a project. I think working together with a team and being able to be open, and transparent about your work is vital to any project. Having a good team member in software development means you have a reliable team and people you can count on to work with you instead of against you in a project. You can learn from each other and teach others so that as a team everyone is successful.
